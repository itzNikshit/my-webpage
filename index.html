      div is an html element that lets programmers divide the webpage in certain parts
      and each part can be styled according to the needs.
      div is content division element and separate each containers
    -->
    <!--
      css display property -> block, inline, inline-block, none
      a) block elements take whole width of screen like h1 or p or div or form or lists tags
      b) span element is an inline display element that lets us style each piece of text differently in a text
      c) span is useless without css
      d) inline elements only take as much as needed like span, img, anchors
      e) we can change display property of each tag according to our need with css
      f) syntax:- display: inline;
      g) inline block uses best of both
      h) none removes the element completely
      i) visibility can be used in order to make it invisible but still exists there
    -->
    <!--
      now comes postioning in css
      we can do postioning in css and we have these positions -> static, relative, absolute, fixed
      a) all html elements are static by default means go along with the html rules and html code order
      b) relative position is basically shifting the element relative to where it should have been in its natutral flow
      c) relative-> left = make margin from left (means shift right), right = from right, and so on
      d) absolute positions are basically it positions the element relative to its parent
      e) absolute-> right = shifts to right literally and so on
      f) relative and absolute are different as when we shifts right an element, the space it left is used by the other elements
      g) but in case of relative, the position was not filled
      h) fixed positioning is the type where we fix the element and even if we scroll on webpage, it sticks to the fixed position
      i) fixed position is used in navbars as they are fixed even if scroll
